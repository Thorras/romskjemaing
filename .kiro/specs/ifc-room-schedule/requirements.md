# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to create room schedules by importing IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files, analyzing surfaces associated with IFC spaces, and exporting the collected data as JSON. The application will provide a streamlined workflow for extracting spatial information from building models and generating structured room schedule data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to import IFC files into the application, so that I can access building model data for room schedule creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an IFC file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and display import status
2. WHEN an IFC file is successfully imported THEN the system SHALL parse the file and extract IFC space entities
3. IF an invalid IFC file is selected THEN the system SHALL display an error message with specific validation details
4. WHEN IFC parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a list of available IFC spaces found in the model

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to view and describe surfaces and space boundaries associated with each IFC space, so that I can document room characteristics and precise boundary properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an IFC space THEN the system SHALL display all surfaces and space boundaries associated with that space
2. WHEN surfaces are displayed THEN the system SHALL show surface type, area, and material properties if available
3. WHEN space boundaries are displayed THEN the system SHALL show boundary type, connection geometry, and related building elements
4. WHEN a user clicks on a surface or boundary THEN the system SHALL allow adding custom descriptions and notes
5. WHEN surface descriptions are added THEN the system SHALL save the descriptions and associate them with the specific surface or boundary
6. WHEN viewing surfaces THEN the system SHALL calculate and display total surface areas by type (walls, floors, ceilings)
7. WHEN space boundaries exist THEN the system SHALL calculate and display accurate boundary areas from IfcSpaceBoundary geometry
8. WHEN displaying IFC space data THEN the system SHALL show GUID, LongName, Name, zone category, and number properties
9. WHEN IFC quantities are available THEN the system SHALL display all IFC quantity values associated with the space
10. WHEN space boundaries are processed THEN the system SHALL identify and display the connection type (physical, virtual, or undefined)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to export room schedule data as JSON, so that I can use the data in other applications or reporting systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing all room, surface, and space boundary data
2. WHEN JSON is generated THEN the system SHALL include room identifiers, surface quantities, space boundary areas, descriptions, and material properties
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link or save dialog for the JSON file
4. IF no rooms have been processed THEN the system SHALL display a warning before allowing export
5. WHEN JSON is exported THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as export date and IFC file source
6. WHEN exporting IFC space data THEN the system SHALL include GUID, LongName, Name, zone category, number, and IFC quantities for each space
7. WHEN exporting relationships THEN the system SHALL include all related IFC entities with their GUID, Name, and Description properties
8. WHEN exporting space boundaries THEN the system SHALL include boundary geometry, connection type, related building elements, and calculated areas
9. WHEN both surfaces and space boundaries exist THEN the system SHALL export both datasets with clear differentiation in the JSON structure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to navigate between different rooms efficiently, so that I can process multiple spaces in a single session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple IFC spaces are available THEN the system SHALL provide a navigation interface showing all rooms
2. WHEN a user selects a room from the navigation THEN the system SHALL load that room's surface data
3. WHEN room data is modified THEN the system SHALL indicate which rooms have been processed or modified
4. WHEN switching between rooms THEN the system SHALL preserve previously entered descriptions and data
5. WHEN all rooms are processed THEN the system SHALL provide a summary view of completed work

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue working even when encountering problematic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IFC parsing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log specific error details and continue processing valid data
2. WHEN surface data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display available information and mark missing data clearly
3. IF the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN errors occur during export THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback about what data could not be exported
5. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL preserve any user input that was successfully processed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to access comprehensive IFC relationship data, so that I can understand how spaces connect to other building elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing IFC spaces THEN the system SHALL extract all relationships to other IFC entities
2. WHEN displaying relationships THEN the system SHALL show GUID, Name, and Description for each related entity
3. WHEN relationships are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them by relationship type (contains, adjacent, serves, etc.)
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include complete relationship information in the JSON output
5. WHEN no relationships exist THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this in the interface and export data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to extract and analyze IfcSpaceBoundary entities, so that I can obtain precise geometric boundaries and thermal properties for each space.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing IFC spaces THEN the system SHALL extract all associated IfcSpaceBoundary entities
2. WHEN space boundaries are found THEN the system SHALL parse boundary geometry and calculate accurate surface areas
3. WHEN displaying space boundaries THEN the system SHALL show connection type (Physical, Virtual, Undefined), related building element, and human-readable identification
4. WHEN space boundaries reference building elements THEN the system SHALL extract element properties including material and thermal characteristics
5. WHEN displaying space boundaries THEN the system SHALL generate descriptive labels indicating boundary orientation, surface type, and adjacent spaces or elements
6. WHEN multiple boundary types exist THEN the system SHALL differentiate between 1st level (space-to-element) and 2nd level (space-to-space) boundaries
7. WHEN boundary geometry is available THEN the system SHALL calculate and display precise boundary areas using IFC geometric representations
8. WHEN processing space boundaries THEN the system SHALL determine and display boundary orientation (North, South, East, West, Horizontal) based on geometry
9. WHEN exporting space boundary data THEN the system SHALL include all geometric, material, thermal properties, and human-readable identifications in the JSON output
