# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables users to create room schedules by importing IFC (Industry Foundation Classes) files, analyzing surfaces associated with IFC spaces, and exporting the collected data as JSON. The application will provide a streamlined workflow for extracting spatial information from building models and generating structured room schedule data.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to import IFC files into the application, so that I can access building model data for room schedule creation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an IFC file THEN the system SHALL validate the file format and display import status
2. WHEN an IFC file is successfully imported THEN the system SHALL parse the file and extract IFC space entities
3. IF an invalid IFC file is selected THEN the system SHALL display an error message with specific validation details
4. WHEN IFC parsing is complete THEN the system SHALL display a list of available IFC spaces found in the model

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to view and describe surfaces associated with each IFC space, so that I can document room characteristics and surface properties.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects an IFC space THEN the system SHALL display all surfaces associated with that space
2. WHEN surfaces are displayed THEN the system SHALL show surface type, area, and material properties if available
3. WHEN a user clicks on a surface THEN the system SHALL allow adding custom descriptions and notes
4. WHEN surface descriptions are added THEN the system SHALL save the descriptions and associate them with the specific surface
5. WHEN viewing surfaces THEN the system SHALL calculate and display total surface areas by type (walls, floors, ceilings)
6. WHEN displaying IFC space data THEN the system SHALL show GUID, LongName, Name, zone category, and number properties
7. WHEN IFC quantities are available THEN the system SHALL display all IFC quantity values associated with the space

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to export room schedule data as JSON, so that I can use the data in other applications or reporting systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests data export THEN the system SHALL generate a JSON file containing all room and surface data
2. WHEN JSON is generated THEN the system SHALL include room identifiers, surface quantities, descriptions, and material properties
3. WHEN export is complete THEN the system SHALL provide a download link or save dialog for the JSON file
4. IF no rooms have been processed THEN the system SHALL display a warning before allowing export
5. WHEN JSON is exported THEN the system SHALL include metadata such as export date and IFC file source
6. WHEN exporting IFC space data THEN the system SHALL include GUID, LongName, Name, zone category, number, and IFC quantities for each space
7. WHEN exporting relationships THEN the system SHALL include all related IFC entities with their GUID, Name, and Description properties

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to navigate between different rooms efficiently, so that I can process multiple spaces in a single session.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple IFC spaces are available THEN the system SHALL provide a navigation interface showing all rooms
2. WHEN a user selects a room from the navigation THEN the system SHALL load that room's surface data
3. WHEN room data is modified THEN the system SHALL indicate which rooms have been processed or modified
4. WHEN switching between rooms THEN the system SHALL preserve previously entered descriptions and data
5. WHEN all rooms are processed THEN the system SHALL provide a summary view of completed work

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that I can continue working even when encountering problematic data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN IFC parsing encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log specific error details and continue processing valid data
2. WHEN surface data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL display available information and mark missing data clearly
3. IF the application encounters unexpected errors THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN errors occur during export THEN the system SHALL provide detailed feedback about what data could not be exported
5. WHEN recovering from errors THEN the system SHALL preserve any user input that was successfully processed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to access comprehensive IFC relationship data, so that I can understand how spaces connect to other building elements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing IFC spaces THEN the system SHALL extract all relationships to other IFC entities
2. WHEN displaying relationships THEN the system SHALL show GUID, Name, and Description for each related entity
3. WHEN relationships are found THEN the system SHALL categorize them by relationship type (contains, adjacent, serves, etc.)
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include complete relationship information in the JSON output
5. WHEN no relationships exist THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this in the interface and export data
