# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enhances the existing room schedule template by adding comprehensive data points for activity management, digital integration, sustainability tracking, cost management, and facility operations. The enhanced template will support modern construction workflows including digital twins, circular economy principles, and comprehensive project lifecycle management while maintaining compatibility with Norwegian building standards and practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want to track construction activities and their lifecycle phases, so that I can better plan and coordinate project execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining a room schedule THEN the system SHALL provide activity type options including "bygging", "riving", "renovering", "ombygging", and "vedlikehold"
2. WHEN specifying an activity THEN the system SHALL allow setting phase as "planlegging", "utførelse", "ferdigstillelse", or "drift"
3. WHEN creating an activity THEN the system SHALL support priority levels of "kritisk", "høy", "normal", and "lav"
4. WHEN defining activities THEN the system SHALL allow specification of dependencies between activities
5. WHEN planning activities THEN the system SHALL support estimated duration in days and actual start/completion dates

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a digital construction specialist, I want to integrate IoT devices and digital twin references into room schedules, so that I can enable smart building functionality and real-time monitoring.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a room schedule THEN the system SHALL allow specification of sensor IDs for the space
2. WHEN defining digital integration THEN the system SHALL support IoT device registration and tracking
3. WHEN linking to BIM models THEN the system SHALL allow multiple BIM model references per room
4. WHEN enabling digital twins THEN the system SHALL provide a unique digital twin ID field
5. WHEN setting up monitoring THEN the system SHALL allow specification of monitoring parameters for the space

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a sustainability coordinator, I want to track circular economy and environmental data for each room, so that I can support green building certifications and material passport requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining sustainability data THEN the system SHALL provide material passport ID tracking
2. WHEN assessing materials THEN the system SHALL allow reuse potential classification as "høy", "medium", or "lav"
3. WHEN planning end-of-life THEN the system SHALL support disassembly plan references
4. WHEN tracking environmental impact THEN the system SHALL allow carbon footprint specification in kg CO2
5. WHEN conducting assessments THEN the system SHALL support LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) reference linking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a cost manager, I want to track detailed economic data for each room, so that I can perform accurate cost analysis and value engineering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN estimating costs THEN the system SHALL allow total estimated cost specification in NOK
2. WHEN analyzing efficiency THEN the system SHALL calculate and display cost per square meter in NOK
3. WHEN conducting analysis THEN the system SHALL support LCC (Life Cycle Cost) analysis references
4. WHEN optimizing value THEN the system SHALL provide fields for value engineering notes and recommendations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a facility manager, I want to define maintenance and operational requirements for each room, so that I can plan long-term building operations effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN planning operations THEN the system SHALL allow specification of cleaning frequency requirements
2. WHEN scheduling maintenance THEN the system SHALL support detailed maintenance schedule definitions
3. WHEN planning lifecycle THEN the system SHALL allow service life specification in years
4. WHEN managing warranties THEN the system SHALL track warranty periods in years
5. WHEN defining operations THEN the system SHALL support FDV (Forvaltning, Drift, Vedlikehold) requirements specification

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want the enhanced template to maintain backward compatibility with existing data, so that current room schedules can be migrated without data loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN upgrading templates THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing data structure elements
2. WHEN adding new fields THEN the system SHALL make all enhancements optional to preserve compatibility
3. WHEN processing existing data THEN the system SHALL handle null values gracefully for new fields
4. WHEN validating schemas THEN the system SHALL support both old and new template versions
5. WHEN migrating data THEN the system SHALL provide clear migration paths for existing room schedules

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a quality assurance manager, I want enhanced validation and cataloging for the new data points, so that data integrity is maintained across all enhanced fields.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN defining catalogs THEN the system SHALL provide predefined options for all new enumerated fields
2. WHEN validating data THEN the system SHALL enforce data type constraints for numeric fields
3. WHEN entering dates THEN the system SHALL validate date formats and logical date sequences
4. WHEN referencing external data THEN the system SHALL validate reference format and accessibility
5. WHEN updating schema versions THEN the system SHALL increment version numbers appropriately
