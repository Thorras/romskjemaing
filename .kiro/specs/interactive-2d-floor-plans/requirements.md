# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will add interactive 2D floor plan visualization to the IFC Room Schedule application. Users will be able to view graphical floor plans for each building level, interact with room spaces through clicking, and access detailed IFC space data through an integrated menu system. The feature aims to provide a visual and intuitive way to explore building data beyond the current tabular export formats.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a building professional, I want to view interactive 2D floor plans for each building level, so that I can visually understand the spatial layout of the building.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads an IFC file THEN the system SHALL extract 2D geometric data for each building level
2. WHEN floor plan data is available THEN the system SHALL display a list of available floors/levels in the interface
3. WHEN a user selects a floor/level THEN the system SHALL render a 2D floor plan showing room boundaries and spaces
4. IF no geometric data is available for a floor THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate message indicating no plan data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a data menu alongside the floor plan, so that I can quickly access room information without losing visual context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a floor plan is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a side panel or menu containing room data from the export file
2. WHEN room data is loaded THEN the menu SHALL display room names, areas, and key properties in a structured list
3. WHEN the menu is displayed THEN the system SHALL allow users to scroll through the room list independently of the floor plan view
4. IF no room data is available THEN the menu SHALL display an appropriate empty state message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on rooms in the floor plan to see detailed information, so that I can explore building data interactively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a room space in the floor plan THEN the system SHALL display detailed IFC space data for that room
2. WHEN room details are shown THEN the system SHALL include all available properties, measurements, and relationships
3. WHEN a room is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding room in the floor plan with a distinct visual indicator
4. WHEN a room is selected THEN the system SHALL scroll the data menu to show the corresponding room entry
5. WHEN a user holds Ctrl and clicks on additional rooms THEN the system SHALL add those rooms to the current selection
6. WHEN multiple rooms are selected THEN the system SHALL highlight all selected rooms with the same visual indicator
7. WHEN multiple rooms are selected THEN the system SHALL display combined or summary information for all selected rooms

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to click on rooms in the data menu to highlight them in the floor plan, so that I can locate specific rooms visually.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a room entry in the data menu THEN the system SHALL highlight the corresponding room in the floor plan
2. WHEN a room is highlighted from the menu THEN the system SHALL use the same visual highlighting as clicking directly on the floor plan
3. WHEN a room is selected from the menu THEN the system SHALL center or pan the floor plan view to ensure the highlighted room is visible
4. WHEN a user holds Ctrl and clicks on additional room entries in the menu THEN the system SHALL add those rooms to the current selection
5. WHEN multiple rooms are selected from the menu THEN the system SHALL highlight all corresponding rooms in the floor plan
6. IF a room from the menu has no corresponding geometry THEN the system SHALL display a message indicating the room cannot be located visually

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to navigate between different floors easily, so that I can explore multi-story buildings efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple floors are available THEN the system SHALL provide clear navigation controls (tabs, dropdown, or buttons)
2. WHEN a user switches floors THEN the system SHALL update both the floor plan view and the data menu to show the selected floor's data
3. WHEN switching floors THEN the system SHALL maintain any selected room highlighting if the same room exists on the new floor
4. WHEN switching floors THEN the system SHALL clear previous room selections if they don't exist on the new floor

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the floor plan to be responsive and interactive, so that I can zoom and pan to examine details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a floor plan THEN the system SHALL support mouse wheel zooming to examine details
2. WHEN viewing a floor plan THEN the system SHALL support click-and-drag panning to navigate large plans
3. WHEN zooming or panning THEN the system SHALL maintain room highlighting and selection states
4. WHEN the view is manipulated THEN the system SHALL provide a reset or fit-to-view option to return to the default view

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the 2D floor plan feature to integrate seamlessly with existing export functionality, so that I can use both visualization and data export together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the floor plan view is active THEN the system SHALL still allow access to all existing export functions (JSON, Excel, PDF, CSV)
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include any currently selected or filtered rooms from the floor plan interaction
3. WHEN using the floor plan THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing IFC file loading and processing workflows
4. IF floor plan data cannot be extracted THEN the system SHALL fall back gracefully to the existing tabular interface without errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage multiple room selections efficiently, so that I can work with groups of rooms for analysis or export.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple rooms are selected THEN the system SHALL provide a clear indication of how many rooms are currently selected
2. WHEN multiple rooms are selected THEN the system SHALL offer a "Clear Selection" option to deselect all rooms
3. WHEN multiple rooms are selected THEN the system SHALL allow users to export data for only the selected rooms
4. WHEN multiple rooms are selected THEN the system SHALL display aggregate information (total area, room count, etc.)
5. WHEN a user clicks on an empty area of the floor plan THEN the system SHALL clear all current selections
6. WHEN rooms are selected across different floors THEN the system SHALL maintain the selection when switching between floors

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear visual feedback and error handling in the floor plan interface, so that I understand what's happening and can recover from issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading floor plan data THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators for data extraction and rendering
2. WHEN floor plan rendering fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with suggested actions
3. WHEN no geometric data is available THEN the system SHALL explain why floor plans cannot be displayed and offer alternatives
4. WHEN room data is incomplete THEN the system SHALL still display available information and indicate what data is missing
