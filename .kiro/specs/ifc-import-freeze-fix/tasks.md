# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix memory constraints in IFC file reader ✅ COMPLETED

  - Adjust memory checks to be less conservative for small files
  - Allow files under 10MB without strict memory validation
  - Improve memory error messages with specific file size information
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 4.1, 4.2_
  - **Status**: Files under 10MB now skip strict memory validation, improved thresholds for larger files

- [x] 2. Implement smart file loading strategy

  - Create file size categorization logic (small/medium/large/huge)
  - Implement direct loading for files under 10MB to avoid threading overhead
  - Add file size-based loading decision in process_ifc_file method
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 5.1_

- [x] 3. Replace blocking progress dialog with status bar progress

  - Remove blocking progress_dialog.exec() call that freezes main thread
  - Implement non-blocking progress indication using QProgressBar in status bar
  - Update show_operation_progress method to use status bar instead of modal dialog
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 4. Add timeout handling for long operations

  - Implement QTimer-based timeout mechanism for IFC loading operations
  - Add configurable timeout values based on file size
  - Create timeout handler with user recovery options (wait longer, cancel, try direct)
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 5. Implement operation cancellation functionality

  - Add cancel button or mechanism for long-running operations
  - Implement proper thread termination and cleanup
  - Ensure UI returns to ready state after cancellation
  - _Requirements: 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 6. Add fallback to direct loading when threading fails

  - Implement error recovery when threading operations fail
  - Create fallback mechanism that attempts direct loading
  - Add logging for threading failures and fallback attempts
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 1.3_

- [x] 7. Improve error messages and logging

  - Enhance error messages for memory-related issues with specific guidance
  - Add detailed logging for file loading operations and timing
  - Implement structured error reporting for debugging freeze issues
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 8. Test with existing test files

  - Verify that AkkordSvingen 23_ARK.ifc loads without freezing
  - Verify that DEICH_Test.ifc loads without freezing
  - Test that both files load within reasonable time limits
  - Ensure all spaces and surfaces are properly extracted and displayed
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3_

- [x] 9. Add comprehensive error recovery testing


  - Test timeout scenarios with simulated slow operations
  - Test cancellation functionality during file loading
  - Test fallback mechanisms when threading fails
  - Verify UI responsiveness during all error conditions
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 10. Optimize resource cleanup and memory management ✅ COMPLETED
  - Ensure proper cleanup of threads and workers after operations
  - Implement memory cleanup for cancelled operations
  - Add resource monitoring and cleanup verification
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3_
  - **Status**: Implemented comprehensive resource cleanup with monitoring, thread/worker cleanup, memory management for cancelled operations, and verification system
