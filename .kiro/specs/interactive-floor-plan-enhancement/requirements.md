# Interactive Floor Plan Enhancement - Requirements

## Introduction

This feature addresses two critical issues in the IFC Room Schedule application:
1. A technical bug where the main window calls a non-existent method on SpaceDetailWidget
2. The need for a comprehensive floor plan view showing all spaces on each floor level, rather than just individual space selection

The enhancement will provide users with an interactive floor plan visualization that shows complete floor layouts with all spaces, enabling better spatial understanding and navigation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix SpaceDetailWidget Interface Bug

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work without crashes when I select a space, so that I can view space details reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a space from the space list THEN the space detail widget SHALL display the space information without errors
2. WHEN the main window calls space detail methods THEN the correct method names SHALL be used consistently
3. WHEN space selection occurs THEN the application SHALL not crash with AttributeError exceptions
4. IF the SpaceDetailWidget interface changes THEN all calling code SHALL be updated to match

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Floor Plan Visualization

**User Story:** As an architect or building professional, I want to see a complete floor plan view of each building level with all spaces visible, so that I can understand the spatial relationships and navigate the building layout effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads an IFC file THEN the application SHALL display a complete floor plan view for each building level
2. WHEN viewing a floor plan THEN all spaces on that level SHALL be visible simultaneously with clear boundaries
3. WHEN a user clicks on a space in the floor plan THEN that space SHALL be highlighted and its details SHALL be displayed
4. WHEN multiple floors exist THEN the user SHALL be able to switch between floor levels easily
5. WHEN spaces are displayed THEN they SHALL show room numbers, names, and basic information as overlays
6. WHEN the floor plan is displayed THEN it SHALL be scalable and pannable for detailed inspection
7. WHEN a space is selected from the space list THEN the corresponding space SHALL be highlighted on the floor plan
8. WHEN the floor plan view is active THEN users SHALL be able to see spatial relationships between adjacent rooms

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Floor Plan Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want intuitive navigation controls for the floor plan view, so that I can efficiently explore building layouts and find specific spaces.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing a floor plan THEN the user SHALL be able to zoom in and out using mouse wheel or controls
2. WHEN viewing a floor plan THEN the user SHALL be able to pan the view by dragging
3. WHEN multiple floors exist THEN a floor selector control SHALL allow switching between levels
4. WHEN a floor is selected THEN the view SHALL update to show only spaces on that level
5. WHEN spaces are too small to show labels THEN tooltips SHALL display space information on hover
6. WHEN the user wants to reset the view THEN a "fit to view" control SHALL center and scale the floor plan appropriately

### Requirement 4: Floor Plan and Space List Synchronization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the floor plan view and space list to stay synchronized, so that selecting a space in one view highlights it in the other view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a space is selected in the space list THEN the corresponding space SHALL be highlighted on the floor plan
2. WHEN a space is clicked on the floor plan THEN it SHALL be selected in the space list
3. WHEN filtering spaces in the space list THEN only matching spaces SHALL be highlighted on the floor plan
4. WHEN clearing space selection THEN both the space list and floor plan SHALL show no selection
5. WHEN switching floors THEN the space list SHALL optionally filter to show only spaces on the current floor

### Requirement 5: Floor Plan Visual Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want the floor plan to be visually clear and informative, so that I can quickly understand the building layout and identify different space types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying spaces THEN different space types SHALL be visually distinguished (e.g., by color coding)
2. WHEN spaces have NS 3940 classifications THEN they SHALL be color-coded according to function type
3. WHEN displaying space boundaries THEN walls, doors, and windows SHALL be clearly visible
4. WHEN a space is selected THEN it SHALL be highlighted with a distinct visual indicator
5. WHEN space information is available THEN room numbers and names SHALL be displayed as text overlays
6. WHEN the view is zoomed out THEN only essential information SHALL be shown to avoid clutter
7. WHEN the view is zoomed in THEN detailed space information SHALL become visible
