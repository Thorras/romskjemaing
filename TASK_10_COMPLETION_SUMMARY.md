# Task 10: Resource Cleanup and Memory Management - Completion Summary

## üéØ Task Overview
**Goal**: Optimize resource cleanup and memory management for cancelled operations and prevent resource leaks.

## ‚úÖ Implementation Completed

### 1. Enhanced Memory Cleanup (`free_memory_resources`)
- **Comprehensive cleanup process** with 8 distinct steps
- **Thread and worker cleanup** as first priority
- **Extractor cache clearing** with forced deletion of large objects
- **IFC file reader data cleanup**
- **UI data cleanup** with error handling
- **Operation state reset** 
- **Multiple garbage collection passes**
- **Memory usage tracking** with before/after comparison

### 2. Robust Thread and Worker Cleanup (`_cleanup_thread_worker_pair`)
- **Graceful shutdown** with 2-second timeout
- **Forced termination** with 3-second timeout
- **Resource leak detection** and logging
- **Signal disconnection** to prevent callbacks during cleanup
- **Proper deletion** with `deleteLater()`
- **Cleanup history tracking** for monitoring

### 3. Cancelled Operation Memory Cleanup (`_cleanup_cancelled_operation_memory`)
- **Partial data cleanup** for cancelled operations
- **Extractor state reset** to clear processing state
- **Forced garbage collection** for cancelled operations
- **Error handling** with warning logs

### 4. Resource Monitoring System
- **Periodic monitoring** every 30 seconds
- **Thread registration/unregistration** system
- **Worker registration/unregistration** system
- **Memory snapshot tracking** (last 10 snapshots)
- **Resource leak detection** for orphaned threads/timers
- **Memory growth detection** with trend analysis
- **Cleanup history tracking** with timestamps

### 5. Resource Monitor Features
- **Active resource counting** (threads, workers, timers)
- **Memory usage tracking** with psutil integration
- **Leak detection alerts** with detailed logging
- **Growth pattern analysis** (>50MB growth triggers warning)
- **Comprehensive reporting** via `get_resource_monitor_report()`

### 6. Enhanced Cancel Operation (`cancel_operation`)
- **Comprehensive cleanup** using new cleanup methods
- **Timeout timer cleanup** with proper deletion
- **Memory cleanup** for cancelled operations
- **Operation state reset** 
- **UI state management**

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Management Improvements
```python
# Before: Basic cache clearing
if hasattr(extractor, '_cache'):
    extractor._cache = None

# After: Comprehensive cleanup with forced deletion
cache_attrs = ['_spaces_cache', '_surfaces_cache', '_boundaries_cache', 
               '_relationships_cache', '_cache', '_data_cache', 
               '_ifc_file', '_parsed_data', '_entity_cache']
for attr in cache_attrs:
    if hasattr(extractor, attr):
        old_value = getattr(extractor, attr)
        setattr(extractor, attr, None)
        if old_value is not None:
            del old_value  # Force deletion
```

### Resource Monitoring
```python
# Resource tracking structure
self.resource_monitor = {
    'active_threads': set(),
    'active_workers': set(),
    'active_timers': set(),
    'memory_snapshots': [],
    'cleanup_history': [],
    'resource_leaks_detected': 0,
    'last_cleanup_verification': None
}
```

### Thread Cleanup Improvements
```python
# Before: Basic termination
if self.operation_thread:
    self.operation_thread.terminate()

# After: Graceful with fallback
thread.quit()
if not thread.wait(2000):  # Graceful timeout
    thread.terminate()
    if not thread.wait(3000):  # Forced timeout
        # Log resource leak
        self.logger.error("Resource leak detected")
```

## üìä Monitoring and Verification

### Automatic Verification
- **30-second intervals** for resource cleanup verification
- **Memory snapshot comparison** for growth detection
- **Active resource counting** for leak detection
- **Cleanup event logging** for audit trail

### Resource Leak Detection
- **Orphaned threads** detection and logging
- **Unexpected timers** identification
- **Memory growth patterns** analysis (>50MB growth warning)
- **Cleanup failure tracking** with detailed error logs

### Reporting
- **Real-time resource status** via `get_resource_monitor_report()`
- **Memory usage trends** with before/after comparison
- **Cleanup history** with timestamps and success/failure tracking
- **Resource leak counts** and detailed descriptions

## üìà Requirements Fulfilled

‚úÖ **Requirement 2.2**: Ensure proper cleanup of threads and workers after operations
‚úÖ **Requirement 2.3**: Implement memory cleanup for cancelled operations
‚úÖ **Bonus**: Add comprehensive resource monitoring and cleanup verification
