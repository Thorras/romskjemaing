# Task 6.1 Completion Summary: Space Boundary Data Extraction and Display

## Overview
Task 6.1 "Implement space boundary data extraction and display" has been successfully completed. This task enhanced the IFC Room Schedule application to extract, process, and display IfcSpaceBoundary entities with comprehensive geometric and property information.

## Completed Features

### 1. Space Boundary Data Extraction
- ✅ **IfcSpaceBoundaryParser**: Fully implemented parser that extracts IfcRelSpaceBoundary entities
- ✅ **Geometric Analysis**: Calculates accurate boundary areas from IFC geometric representations
- ✅ **Property Extraction**: Extracts all boundary properties including:
  - Physical/Virtual/Undefined boundary types
  - Internal/External boundary classification
  - Related building element information
  - Connection geometry and calculated areas
  - Boundary orientation detection (North, South, East, West, Horizontal)
  - Surface type classification (Wall, Floor, Ceiling, Window, Door, etc.)

### 2. Enhanced Data Models
- ✅ **SpaceBoundaryData**: Comprehensive data model with validation
- ✅ **SpaceData Integration**: Space model now includes space_boundaries collection
- ✅ **Display Label Generation**: Human-readable labels like "North Wall to Office 101"

### 3. UI Enhancements
- ✅ **Space Boundaries Tab**: New dedicated tab in SpaceDetailWidget
- ✅ **Enhanced Table Display**: 8-column table showing:
  - Display Label (human-readable identification)
  - Type (Physical/Virtual with visual indicators)

  - Orientation (with directional icons)
  - Calculated Area
  - Element Type
  - Boundary Level
  - User Description
- ✅ **Visual Indicators**: Icons and formatting to differentiate boundary types
- ✅ **Detailed Summary**: Statistics showing counts by type, level, and total areas

### 4. Area Calculations
- ✅ **Accurate Area Calculation**: Multiple methods for calculating boundary areas:
  - From related building element quantities
  - From IFC geometric representations
  - From vertex triangulation as fallback
