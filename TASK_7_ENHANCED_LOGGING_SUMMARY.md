- **Timeout Errors**: User-friendly timeout handling with extension options
- **IO Errors**: File access troubleshooting with permission guidance

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Memory Error Analysis
```python
# Intelligent memory error analysis
guidance, suggestions = MemoryErrorAnalyzer.analyze_memory_error(
    file_size_bytes, available_memory_bytes, exception
)

# Memory recommendations based on file size
recommendations = MemoryErrorAnalyzer.get_memory_recommendations(file_size_mb)
```

### 2. Operation Timing
```python
# Detailed operation timing with context
operation_id = enhanced_logger.start_operation_timing("ifc_file_load", file_path)
# ... operation execution ...
timing = enhanced_logger.finish_operation_timing(operation_id)
```

### 3. Structured Error Reporting
```python
# Comprehensive error reports
error_report = enhanced_logger.create_error_report(
    category=ErrorCategory.MEMORY,
    severity=ErrorSeverity.HIGH,
    title="Memory Error",
    message="Out of memory during IFC parsing",
    user_guidance="Specific guidance for this error type",
    recovery_suggestions=["Close other applications", "Try smaller file"]
)
```

2025-09-28 11:38:51,895 - OPERATION_COMPLETE: ifc_parsing (duration=0.11s, file_size=2.3MB, rate=20.22MB/s, memory_usage=73.4MB)
2025-09-28 11:38:51,506 - Space quality analysis completed in 0.00s:
2025-09-28 11:38:51,507 -   - Valid spaces: 10/10
2025-09-28 11:38:51,508 -   - Named spaces: 10/10
2025-09-28 11:38:51,509 -   - Spaces with geometry: 10/10
```

### Memory Analysis Examples:
```
File: 50.0MB, Available Memory: 4.0GB
Guidance: The file (50.0MB) is large relative to your available memory (4096.0MB). Processing may be slow or fail.
Recovery suggestions:
  1. Close unnecessary applications
  2. Try processing during off-peak system usage
  3. Consider upgrading system memory for large IFC files
Recommendations:
  recommended_ram: 16GB or more
  processing_time: 2 to 5 minutes
  memory_usage: ~200MB
```
