# 2D Floor Plan Visualization Improvements

## Current State Analysis

The current 2D floor plan implementation has a solid foundation with:
- ✅ Multi-floor support with floor selector
- ✅ Basic room polygon rendering with NS 3940 color coding
- ✅ Zoom, pan, and navigation controls
- ✅ Room selection and highlighting
- ✅ Space labels with zoom-dependent visibility
- ✅ Hover effects and visual feedback

## Identified Areas for Improvement

### 1. Visual Quality Enhancements
- **Better anti-aliasing and rendering quality**
- **Improved color schemes and contrast**
- **Enhanced room labeling with better typography**
- **More sophisticated visual feedback for interactions**

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Viewport culling for large floor plans**
- **Level-of-detail rendering based on zoom level**
- **Optimized polygon rendering**
- **Better memory management for large datasets**

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- **Smoother zoom and pan interactions**
- **Better keyboard shortcuts and accessibility**
- **Improved room search and filtering**
- **Enhanced selection tools (multi-select, area select)**

### 4. Advanced Features
- **Room measurement tools**
- **Grid overlay and snap-to-grid**
- **Export floor plan as image**
- **Print-friendly layouts**

### 5. Architectural Drawing Standards
- **Better compliance with Norwegian building standards**
- **Improved space type categorization**
- **Professional drawing symbols and annotations**
- **Scale indicators and north arrow**

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Visual quality and performance
